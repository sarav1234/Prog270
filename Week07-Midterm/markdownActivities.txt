Things To Do
============

<hr />

At Clear Lake, there are a lot of things to do if you enjoy spending time outdoors. First of all, there are several beautiful campgrounds. I highly recommend going there during the summer. While enjoying the natural and sleeping under the stars, you can go fishing. The following fish are found at Clear Lake.

* Brown Bullhead  ![Brown bullhead](/Images/brownBullhead.jpg "Brown Bullhead")

* Largemouth Bass ![Largemouth bass](/Images/largemouthBass.jpg "Largemouth Bass")
* Channel Catfish ![Channel catfish](/Images/channelCatfish.jpg "Channel Catfish")

You can also go hiking. There's a road that goes all around Clear Lake; and at some point, the road goes over a river and this is the view you get early in the morning.

You can obviously go swimming in the lake. The water is not too cold and there are several places where there is sand on the bottom.
